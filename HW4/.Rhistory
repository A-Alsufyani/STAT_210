```
The arguement line = r makes it a robust regression line. which means it becomes more resistant to outlier data. this gives a better visualisation to check normality
Comparing the histogram and estimated density with the normal curve. there is some difference but normality is possible
We then did the Q-Q test with the points lying close to the normality line. thus the assumption that the data is normally distributed is valid.
```{r}
alpha <- 0.01
n <- length(data$emss1)
t_critical <- qt(1 - alpha, df = n - 1)
upper_bound <- mean_emss1 + t_critical * sd_emss1 / sqrt(n)
c(-Inf, upper_bound)
````
to get the lower one-sided 100 - alpha confidence interval for the mean the region would be mean + t-critical value * sd / sqrt(n)
applied above we found the region to be from - infinity to 191.436, and the reference value of 191.5 doesn't lie in our 99% confidence interval.
Identical conditions (low variance): assumed since we were told identical cars were used under similar conditions in city traffic.
approximately normally distributedd: this was further explored in part A where we used the histogram and Q-Q plot to check normality and we had strong evidence of normality
and given that the sample n is small (25), the t-test is most appropriate.
the test statistic formula is t = (mean - mu) / (sd / sqrt(n)) with mu being our hypothesis (191.5).
```{r}
(mean_emss1 - 191.5) / (sd_emss1 / sqrt(25));
```
and we reject  the hypothesis if t <= 2.5206
Type 1 error (False Positive): concluding that the new system reduces CO2 (rejecting hypothesis) even though mu = 191.5.
Type 2 error (False Negative): failing to detect reduction (accepting hypothesis) even though mu < 191.5
```{r}
t.test(data$emss1, mu = 191.5, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.99)
```
The wilcoxon signed rank test could be thought of as the non-parametric version of the one-sample t-test. it is used to check if the median of the population differs
from a specified value (the given 191.5).
Assumptions for this test are similar, but the most important difference is it does not require approximate normality.
Independence: samples are measured independently (satisfed as given).
Continuous distribution: the measured data is continuous.
Symmetry: the data should be symmetrical around the median (shown in the histogram and qq plot in part A).
therefore we choose a H0 to be mu = 191.5, and  H1 to be < 191.5
```{r}
wilcox.test(data$emss1,
mu = 191.5,
alternative = "less",
conf.level = 0.99)
```
we found the p-value to be 0.01032 > 0.01. which means we fail to reject H0. this contradicts our previous result from the t-test but given that
the t-test rejected the hypothesis, and the p-value of the wilcox test was very close to the p-value of rejection (0.01 or less).
we can say that we have stronger evidence that the new system does in fact lower CO2 emissions.
```{r}
data2 <- read.table("25Fhw4Q2")
#create a boxplot of the two sets
boxplot(data2$wt1, data2$wt2,
names = c("Before", "After"),
main = "Rat Weights Before and After Drug Treatment",
ylab = "Weight (grams)",
col = c("blue", "green"))
#create a plot of the data using wt1 on x and wt2 on y. each rat of the 15 gets one point
plot(data2$wt1, data2$wt2,
main = "Before vs After Weight per Rat",
xlab = "Before (wt1)",
ylab = "After (wt2)",
pch = 19, col = "purple")
#create a line with slope 1 to show the no difference in weight (before = after)
abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```
The boxplot shows that almost all parametters (mean, sd...) of the weight were reduced in the "after" sample.
The scatter plot shows all but one of the data points being under the no-change line. which means that the majority of rats had a weight reduction.
The hypothesis H0 is that mu = 0 (no weight change), and alternative H1 is mu < 0 (weight reduction).
Since we have before and after sets, this presents what is called paired measurements. we do a quick qqplot to determine normality and choose a proper test
```{r}
diff <- data2$wt2 - data2$wt1
qqPlot(diff, line = "r", main = "Normal Q-Q Plot for the difference in rat weight")
t.test(diff,
mu = 0,
alternative = "less"
conf.level = 0.99)
t.test(diff,
mu = 0,
alternative = "less",
conf.level = 0.99)
t.test(data2$wt2, data2$wt1,
paired = TRUE,
alternative = "less",
conf.level = 0.99)
t.test(diff,
mu = 0,
alternative = "less",
conf.level = 0.99)
t.test(data2$wt2, data2$wt1,
paired = TRUE,
alternative = "less",
conf.level = 0.99)
t.test(diff,
mu = 0,
alternative = "less",
conf.level = 0.99)
t.test(data2$wt2, data2$wt1,
paired = TRUE,
alternative = "less",
conf.level = 0.99)
t.test(diff,
mu = 0,
alternative = "less",
conf.level = 0.99)
